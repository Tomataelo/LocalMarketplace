Welcome to the repository of my LocalMarketplace application.
This app will include features such as service request creation by customers, offers from service providers (or vice versa), email notifications sent to providers when new requests are added, as well as calendar management and review functionality.

The backend is built with Symfony and PostgreSQL, and the frontend will be developed using React. Currently, I am in the process of developing the backend.
